"""This module implements an interface for reading LOFAR TBB data.

This module is strongly based on pyCRtools module tbb.py by Pim Schellart, Tobias Winchen, and others.
However, it has been completely re-written for use with LOFAR-LIM

Author: Brian Hare

Definitions:
LOFAR is split into a number of different stations. There are three main types: Core Stations (CS), Remote Stations (RS), and international stations
Each station contains 96 low band antennas (LBA) and 48 high band antennas (HBA). Each antenna is dual polarized.

Each station is refered to by its name (e.g. "CS001"), which is a string, or its ID (e.g. 1), which is an integer. In general, these are different!
The mapping, however, is unique and is given in utilities.py

There are a few complications with reading the data.
1) The data from each station is often spread over multiple files
    There is a class below that can combine multiple files (even from different stations)
2) It is entirely possible that one file could contain multiple stations
    This feature is not used, so I assume that it isn't a problem (for now)
3) Each Station has unknown clock offsets. Technically the core stations are all on one clock, but there are some unknown cable delays
    This is a difficult  problem, not handled here
4) Each Antenna doesn't necisarily start reading data at precisely the same time.
    The code below picks the latest start time so this problem can be ignored by the end user
5) The software that inserts metadata (namely antenna positions and callibrations) sometimes "forgets" to do its job
    The code below will automatically read the metadata from other files when necisary
6) LOFAR is constantly changing
    So..keeping code up-to-date and still backwards compatible will be an interesting challange

7) LOFAR only has 96 RCUs (reciever control units) per station (at the moment).
    Each RCU is essentually one digitizer. Each antenna needs two RCS to record both polarizations. The result is only 1/3 of the antennas can
    be read out each time.

    LOFAR keeps track of things with two ways. First, the data is all refered to by its RCUid. 0 is the 0th RCU, ect... However, which antenna
    corresponds to which RCU depends on the antennaSet. For LOFAR-LIM the antenna set will generally be "LBA_OUTER". This could change, and sometimes
    the antenna set is spelled wrong in the data files. (This should be handeld here though)

    In the code below each RCU is refered to by ANTENNA_NAME or antennaID. These are the same thing (I think). They are, however, a misnomer, as they
    actually refer to the RCU, not antenna. The specific antenna depends on the antenna set. For the same antenna set, however, the ANTENNA_NAME will
    always refer to the same antenna.

    Each ANTENNA_NAME is a string of 9 digits. First three is the station ID (not name!), next three is the group (no idea, don't ask), final 3 is the RCU id

    For LBA_INNER data set, even RCU ids refer to X-polarized dipoles and odd RCU ids refer to Y-polarized dipoles. This is flipped for LBA_OUTER antenna set.
    X-polarization is NE-SW, and Y-polarization is NW-SE. antenna_responce.py, which handles the antenna function, assumes the data is LBA_OUTER.
